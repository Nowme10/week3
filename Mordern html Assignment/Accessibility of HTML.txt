HTML accessibility
   1. Easier to develop and  you get some functionality for free, plus it is arguably easier to understand.
   2. Better on mobile — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.
   3. Good for SEO — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic <div>s, etc., so your documents will be more findable by customers.
